# simple-react-native

As the name suggests introducing a simple and faster way to develop react native apps.
***
Why does every developer need to spend the same amount of time to develop the same screens or components?
* The main intention of this package is providing template screens which are used frequently in almost every app.
* And providing wrapper or abstract components upon existing react native components.
* All props are optional.
* This will reduce the development time. 
* We can develop POC (Proof Of Concept) apps quickly by calling the specified components directly without using any props.
* Once we utilize all the provided props and callbacks, we can develop fully functional production apps. Everyone can use their own images, colors and themes by applying corresponding props. 
 

Initially we added Splash,Login and Signup. More components will be coming soon like side drawer, bottom navigation bar and etc.
